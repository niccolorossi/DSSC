script1.sh contains the details concerning compilation and execution of the file parallelpi.c.
In the main I've written the code for reduction, critical and atomical pragmas (two of them are currently commented)
In the files scalabilityc.txt, scalabilitya.txt and scalabilityr.txt there are the results of three tests, where each
time a different pragma has been employed (critical, atomic and reduction respectively)
comparison.png graphs time vs. number of threads for the three files
It seems that all these procedures yield similar results, with critical being slightly slower than the others for n=20.
