## CUDA Exercises
square.cu contains a simple CUDA kernel to inizialize a matrix. The other programs are dedicated to the matrix transpose 
problem, more specifically two algorithms are presented here ("fast" and "naive"). 

The "fast" programs solve the problem for different sizes of matrices of type int. At the end of the execution
the elapsed time during the kernel call and the result of a correctness test are printed.
